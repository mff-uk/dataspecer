 * Originally the schema point only to root classes. The rest of the diagram
 * has been loaded by resolving the referenced entities.
 *
 * This mean that each class must be either a root class or added to
 * diagram as an association. This is not possible as in order to create
 * an association the class must already exists. So before adding the
 * association the class would need to be root class, and after the association
 * is created the class would be removed from the root class list.
 * Such approach would make it difficult to manage the schema.
 *
 * A solution is to introduce list of all parts. This list contains
 * all resources in the schema. A class can then be optionally added
 * to the list of root classes.
