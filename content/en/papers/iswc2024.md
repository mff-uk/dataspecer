This page is a landing page for the [ISWC 2024 Demo](https://iswc2024.semanticweb.org/event/3715c6fc-e2d7-47eb-8c01-5fe4ac589a52/websitePage:ce220901-6898-4fcc-be38-49193794a797?tm=QLST-3OD03RslebCRIVzGyOABTZJAKLJIULY8p37Rms) submission _Towards Easier Authoring of Vocabularies and Application Profiles using Dataspecer_.

Dataspecer [source code is on GitHub](https://github.com/mff-uk/dataspecer), the demo instance is running from the [`iswc2024` branch](https://github.com/mff-uk/dataspecer/tree/iswc2024).

In our demo instance, you can try building your own vocabulary and application profile, or you can follow our [Demo scenario](#demo-scenario) described below.

Alternatively, you can watch a video of us going through the scenario.

## Demo scenario

The demo scenario consists of three parts.
For the first part, we are in the role of Alice, who wants to create an RDFS-based vocabulary and publish it on the Web, including its human-readable documentation.
For the sake of reusability, a vocabulary is just a list of classes and properties defined in the vocabulary, with to specific application context presumed.

For the second part, we are in the role of Bob, who wants to create an application profile, describing a specific usage context, combining terms from different vocabularies, adjusting names, definitions and usage notes to the specific context of the application profile, defining cardinalities of relationships etc.

For the third part, Carol creates an application profile of an application profile, further adjusting usage description of some of the concepts to her context.

### Part I - Vocabulary creation and publication

For this scenario, we will create a subset of the [W3C Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT)](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/) from scratch. You can open the existing DCAT specification as a source of labels and definitions.
1. Go to [demo instance](https://iswc2024.dataspecer.com/) and click on the _Project Wizard_ button.
2. Click on _Vocabulary_ and fill in
   1. Name: "DCAT"
   2. Description: "DCAT in Dataspecer"
   3. Base IRI `http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#`
   4. Base URL documentation - This is the URL where the finished documentation will be published. We used GitHub pages and `https://mff-uk.github.io/demo-specifications/test1/` - you can use another one. This URL will be used later for profiling the specification.
3. Click on the _Create_ button, which will take you to the graphical vocabulary editor.
4. Create new classes with `IRIs`, **labels** and *definitions* (optional) by clicking on _Add a new class_ button in the left hand part of the screen, or alternatively by holding _left alt_ and click on the canvas.
   1. [`dcat:Resource`](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/#Class:Resource), **Cataloged Resource**, *Resource published or curated by a single agent.*
   2. [`dcat:Catalog`](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/#Class:Catalog), **Catalog**, *A curated collection of metadata about resources.*
   3. [`dcat:Dataset`](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/#Class:Dataset), **Dataset**, *A collection of data, published or curated by a single agent, and available for access or download in one or more representations.*
   4. [`dcat:Distribution`](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/#Class:Distribution), **Distribution**, *A specific representation of a dataset.*
   5. [`dcat:Role`](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/#Class:Role), **Role**, *A role is the function of a resource or agent with respect to another resource, in the context of resource attribution or resource relationships.*
5. Specify that `dcat:Catalog` is a subclass of `dcat:Dataset` and `dcat:Dataset` is a subclass of `dcat:Resource` by dragging a connection from an `s` port of the subclass to the `t` port of the superclass and choosing the _generalization_ connection type.
6. Now we want to specify that `dcat:Role` is subclass of `skos:Concept` - a class from a different vocabulary
    1. [SKOS](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/) does not have a machine readable representation linked from the spec, we need to find it first. From the references, we can see that it is located at `http://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/skos.rdf`. However, this location does not support [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS), which is required to read the file from the browser. So we use our cache at `https://datagov-cz.github.io/cache-slovniku/skos.rdf`.
    2. Click on the _+model_ button in the _model catalog_ in the top left part of the screen and insert `https://datagov-cz.github.io/cache-slovniku/skos.rdf`.
    3. Add `skos:Concept` to the canvas by clicking on 🕶️ next to it in the project browser in the left part of the screen.
    4. Drag the generalization from `dcat:Role` to `skos:Concept` - this shows reuse of external vocabularies.
7. Create new DCAT attribute (OWL datatype property) with `IRIs`, labels, definitions (optional) by double-clicking on the domain class and selecting _✏️ Modify_, then _➕ add attribute_.
    1. on _Dataset_: [`dcat:temporalResolution`](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/#Property:dataset_temporal_resolution), **temporal resolution**, *Minimum time period resolvable in the dataset.*, range: `xsd:duration`
    2. click on _✅ add_ to save the attribute and _✅ modify_ to save the class. The attribute shows up on the canvas.
8. Create new DCAT relationships (OWL object properties) with IRIs, labels, definitions (optional), domains and ranges by dragging a connection and choosing the Association type
   1. `dcat:Catalog` -- [`dcat:dataset`](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/#Property:catalog_dataset) --> `dcat:Dataset`, **dataset**, *A dataset that is listed in the catalog.*
   2. `dcat:Dataset` -- [`dcat:distribution`](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/#Property:dataset_distribution) --> `dcat:Distribution`, **distribution**, *An available distribution of the dataset.*
9. Now we add relationships with range specified by existing vocabulary. First we need to import the existing vocabularies, and add the range classes to canvas, so that we can drag the relationship to them.
   1. Add RDFS vocabulary: _+ model_, our RDFS cache: `https://datagov-cz.github.io/cache-slovniku/rdfs.ttl`
   2. Add `rdfs:Resource` to canvas
   3. `dcat:Distribution` -- [`dcat:accessURL`](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/#Property:distribution_access_url), --> `rdfs:Resource`, **access URL**, *A URL of the resource that gives access to a distribution of the dataset. E.g., landing page, feed, SPARQL endpoint.*
   4. Add `skos:ConceptScheme` to canvas
   5. Add `dcat:Catalog` -- [`dcat:themeTaxonomy`](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/#Property:catalog_themes) --> `skos:ConceptScheme`, **themes**, *A knowledge organization system (KOS) used to classify the resources documented in the catalog (e.g., datasets and services).*
   6. Add `dcat:Resource` -- [`dcat:theme`](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/#Property:resource_theme) --> `skos:Concept`, **theme/category**, here the IRI autosuggestion will not be correct due to the '/' char
   7. And we specify a subproperty relation: `dcat:theme` `rdfs:subPropertyOf` `dcterms:subject`
      1. Import `dcterms` from our cache `https://datagov-cz.github.io/cache-slovniku/dublin_core_terms.ttl` using _+ model_
      2. Doubleclick on the _theme/category_ relationship on canvas, or the `✏️` button next to it in the `relationships` tab of the project browser on the left
      3. _➕ add generalization_
      4. choose _Subject_ and click on _✅ add_ and _✅ modify_
10. Now we have our vocabulary with classes, properties, subclasses and subproperties and pointing to terms from external vocabularies ready to be published.
11. Click on _💾pkg & 👋_ in the top toolbar to get back to the specification manager.
12. Click on the three-dot menu by the current project and _📄Show documentation_ to preview the specification.
    1.  Optional: some manual metadata and texts are missing. They can be added in the Respec template by clicking the three-dot menu and _Modify documentation template_ - [Respec configuration knowledge](https://respec.org/docs/) is required here. You may try replacing the var `respecConfig` like so:
```js
var respecConfig = {
          specStatus: "unofficial",
          editors: [
            { name: "John Editor", company: "John's Business" },
            { name: "Jane Editor"}
            ]
          github: "https://github.com/mff-uk/demo-specifications/",
          shortName: "todo",
          //xref: "web-platform",
          //group: "my-working-group",
        };
```
13.  Note the Attachments chapter where the vocabulary is available as an RDFS/OWL file, and note the source code of the spec, which includes a machine readable representation of the spec, including the reused vocabularies and generated artifacts described by the [Data Specification Vocabulary](https://w3id.org/dsv#).
14.  Click on the three-dot menu and _📁 Export specification_ to download a ZIP file, which can be extracted and published e.g. in GitHub pages.

### Part II - Profiling

Now I want to create the DCAT "Default application profile" - set cardinalities, usage notes, include classes and properties from other vocabularies directly.

Notation: `DCAT::dcat:Catalog` means `dcat:Catalog` class profile in application profile called `DCAT`. will not suffice for multiple profiles of the same thing in the same profile, but we can deal with that later.

1. I will "create a profile of" the previously published DCAT as simple as possible - via providing the URL of the spec document. Thanks to machine readable links and machine readable representation of the profile, I expect to land in CME with the DCAT, DCTERMS and SKOS models loaded, possibly even with a view created previously in scope of DCAT. _here we need to think about external representation of the view - not currently covered by DSV - could it be "just a JSON" artifact? I suppose so..._
    1. **TODO: We are missing the DSV -> DS import functionality**
    2. This is where we are better than the SKOS and DCTERMS reuse before _TODO Kuba: Check that there are no machine readable links in SKOS and DCTERMS pages_
    3. Also consider already automatically creating profiles of everything found in DCAT (Petr). If not, create profiles of everything found in DCAT manually.
2. Add class profiles
   1. Add `DCAT::dcat:Resource` class profile to serve as domain
   2. Add `DCAT::dcat:Distribution` class profile to serve as domain
   3. Add `DCAT::dcat:Dataset` class profile
   4. Add `DCAT::dcat:Catalog` class profile
   5. Add class profile `DCAT::foaf:Agent` from FOAF (`https://datagov-cz.github.io/cache-slovniku/foaf.ttl`)
3. Add attribute profiles
    1. `DCAT::dcterms:title` - domain `DCAT::dcat:Resource` (was `owl:Thing`), cardinality `1..*`, range `rdfs:Literal`, name `title` was `Title` - (https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/#Property:resource_title)
    2. `DCAT::dcterms:description` - domain `DCAT::dcat:Resource` (was `owl:Thing`), cardinality `0..*`, range `rdfs:Literal` (was undefined), name `description` was `Description` - (https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/#Property:resource_description)
    3. `DCAT::dcat:Distribution`: `DCAT::dcterms:title` - here, the domain is Distribution - domain: `DCAT::dcat:Distribution`, name `title` was `Title`, description `A name given to the distribution.`, range `rdf:langString`
    4. `DCAT::dcat:Distribution`: `DCAT::dcterms:description`  - domain `DCAT::dcat:Distribution`, name `description` was `Description`, range `rdf:langString`

4. Add relationship profiles
    1. `DCAT::dcat:Catalog`: `DCAT::dcterms:publisher` -> `DCAT::foaf:Agent` - name `An entity responsible for making the catalog available.` was `An entity responsible for making the resource available.`, domain `DCAT::dcat:Catalog`, range `DCAT::foaf:Agent`, cardinality `1..1`
    2. `DCAT::dcat:Dataset`: `DCAT::dcat:distribution` -> `DCAT::dcat:Distribution` - domain and range changed to profiles, cardinality `0..*`

Now I have my application profile. I want to publish the result again.
There will be a respec, and it will link to the reused classes/properties in the previously published DCAT and other vocabularies

Respec will be accompanied by a machine readable (DSV) representation of the profile.

### Part III - Open a profile for further profiling
In DS, I need to be able to import the published profile - it needs to import the reused vocabularies and the application profile itself based on DSV, including views.
Here, we can end - it is clear that we can iterate the process.
